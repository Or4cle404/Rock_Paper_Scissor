1. Rock: Shaped by making a fist with your hand.
2. Paper: Created by extending your hand flat with fingers together.
3. Scissors: Made by extending your hand and separating your index and middle fingers to form a "V" shape.

The objective of the game is to defeat your opponent by selecting a hand gesture that defeats theirs. The rules of rock-paper-scissors are straightforward:

- Rock crushes scissors: If a player shows rock and the other shows scissors, the rock wins.
- Scissors cut paper: Scissors defeat paper.
- Paper covers rock: Paper defeats rock.

If both players reveal the same hand gesture, it results in a tie, and the game is usually played again.
